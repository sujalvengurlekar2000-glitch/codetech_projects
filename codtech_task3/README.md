NLP Chatbot – Project Description (Short & Professional)

This project is a simple Rule-Based NLP Chatbot built using Python and the NLTK library as part of the CODTECH Python Internship Task 3.
The chatbot interacts with the user through predefined patterns and responses using regular expressions. 
It demonstrates the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing, pattern matching, and conversational flow.
Although basic, it effectively showcases how chatbots work behind the scenes without advanced machine learning. 
This makes it a great foundational project for beginners exploring NLP, chatbots, and Python automation.


Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3 – Primary programming language for building the chatbot

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – Used for handling text processing and conversation logic

nltk.chat.util.Chat – Manages interactive conversation

nltk.chat.util.reflections – Applies simple pronoun transformations

Regular Expressions (RegEx) – Matches user inputs with predefined patterns

Command Line Interface (CLI) – Chatbot runs directly in terminal

Visual studio Code (Environment)


How the Chatbot Works

Predefined input patterns and responses are stored in a list called pairs

The Chat class matches user text with RegEx patterns

When a match is found, an appropriate response is selected

Handles greetings, questions, and exit commands

Continues conversation until the user types: bye, quit, or exit



Applications

Basic FAQ bots for small businesses

Education and learning tools for teaching NLP concepts

Interactive tutorials or demos

Prototypes before building advanced AI chatbots

Academic / internship / mini project submissions

Simple automation of repeated customer queries
