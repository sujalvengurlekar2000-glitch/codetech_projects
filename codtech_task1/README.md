*Task Description*

This task focuses on developing a Python-based Weather Forecast Visualization tool
that retrieves 5-day weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API 
and displays temperature trends in the form of a line graph. 
The main goal of this task is to demonstrate how real-world data can be collected from an external API, 
processed using Python, and visualized through a graphical representation. 
By completing this task, users learn the fundamentals of API integration, 
JSON handling, data extraction, and data visualization using Python libraries.
It is a practical and beginner-friendly task that introduces core concepts used in real data-driven applications.
